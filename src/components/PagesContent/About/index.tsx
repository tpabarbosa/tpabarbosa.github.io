            <p>Since I first got a computer and saw a black screen with something blinking in front of my eyes, I have been asking myself </p> 
            
            <p className='special'>what can I do with that?</p>

            <p>Soon I learnt my first command, and after that some others, and finally the most important ones: <code>help</code> or <code>/?</code>. This was a breaking moment, something had changed forever... I could never stop!</p>

            <p>But life is something really <strong>incredible</strong> and <strong>unpredictable</strong>, and I became a Biologist and started working as a Teacher. I must say, not a very conventional Biologist, because I really enjoy numbers,  logical thinking, computers, statistics, all those things that geeks like. Then I started teaching not only Biology, but Maths and Physics too.</p>

            <p>Sometimes as a hobby, somethimes to help solving problems or needs that I had, I never left coding and always implemented my own programs, apps, sites, scripts...</p>
